# algae_binary_classifier

This classifier was created as a project with **Chloe Wang, Jolie Li, Varun Suvvari, Katie Kim, Teja Yadagani, and Johnny Vu** as part of the OUR Research Education and Opportunities program at UNLV. The algorithm is a binary classifier that identifies water with algae overgrowth and water without algae overgrowth. 

## Abstract: 
Algae (cyanobacteria) growth is a major environmental issue across numerous critical bodies of water that threatens the survival of aquatic populations by severely reducing oxygen availability in water and blocking sunlight for underwater plants. Recently, algal blooms have not only increased in frequency, but also in their toxicity, making it important to detect and treat the problem before the harm escalates. This paper discusses the development of a binary image CNN classifier for detecting major algae blooms. The data was collected from the internet and compiled 100 images of water with and without algae blooms. The CNN architecture utilizes a convolutional layer and dense layer, and relies on the RELU and sigmoid activation functions. The architecture resulted in an 95% accuracy in detecting algae in images. Our proposed program shows the possibilities of being able to identify harmful cyanobacteria in natural water sources via drones, satellites, and other imaging technology.
